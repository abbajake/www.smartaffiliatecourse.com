    <h2>Affiliate Marketing Is A Boom Industry...</h2>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">Affiliate Marketing is a growing industry. Just check out what Wikipedia says:</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><em>&quot;Affiliate marketing has grown quickly since its inception. The e-commerce website, viewed as a marketing toy in the early days of the Internet, became an integrated part of the overall business plan and in some cases grew to a bigger business than the existing offline business. According to one report, the total sales amount generated through affiliate networks in 2006 was £2.16 billion in the United Kingdom alone. The estimates were £1.35 billion in sales in 2005. MarketingSherpa's research team estimated that, in 2006, affiliates worldwide earned US$6.5 billion in bounty and commissions from a variety of sources in retail, personal finance, gaming and gambling, travel, telecom, education, publishing, and forms of lead generation other than contextual advertising programs such as Google AdSense.</em></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><em>Currently the most active sectors for affiliate marketing are the adult, gambling, and retail industries. The three sectors expected to experience the greatest growth are the mobile phone, finance, and travel sectors. Soon after these sectors came the entertainment (particularly gaming) and Internet-related services (particularly broadband) sectors. Also several of the affiliate solution providers expect to see increased interest from business-to-business marketers and advertisers in using affiliate marketing as part of their mix.&quot;</em></p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Now, You Can Be Your Own Boss Too…</h2>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"> </p>
    <p align="justify">How, you ask? Well, just take advantage of the most powerful industry at the moment: <strong><em>Affiliate Marketing…</em> Imagine taking advantage of globalization…</strong></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">You can sell your own product or service (or a product or service from someone else), and you’ll be selling it to another person somewhere else… <strong>Imagine the feeling of being paid even when you’re sleeping, on holidays, or when you’re just not in front of your computer… It’s truly magic!</strong></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">If you're thinking, &quot;Hey, this must be too hard?!&quot; or something like &quot;I have no idea of how this works...&quot;, let me tell you upfront that this is something that everybody can do and I'll explain you how everything works in detail! You'll be simply amazed with the work, time and money involved... <strong>Such low investment for a very high return...</strong></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Well, But I Must Need To Make An Investment, Right?</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">Wrong! It’s not difficult to make money in Affiliate Marketing and the best part is that <strong>you can start with a very small investment or no investment at all…</strong></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">Everyone who knows how to use a computer and who has an Internet connection has everything that is needed to succeed…</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">And, of course, <strong>you need the right course to help you…</strong></p>
